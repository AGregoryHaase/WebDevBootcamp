        OKay, I'm having to watch a video on youtube to figure out how to do this. 
        You can see the video here -> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kWHW7da4U8" target=blank>vid on gradients</a> <br>
        Right, so you have to use it as an image and you have to create a box, I think. 
        <img src="Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 10.07.05." alt="fuck, I can't even remember how to do an image!!!">

    <div class="box">
       <p>it won't work. How did the guy in the video get his page to update automatically??</p>
       <p>yoooo I did it. I hadn't put the link tag into the head. Under the meta and title tags you put in the link to the style sheet. MEGA. Cool. NOw I can mess about with it a bit</p>
