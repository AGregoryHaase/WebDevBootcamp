        <h2>Function Scope</h2>
        <p>
            Colt creates a function called collect eggs. and inside the function he creates a variable called
            let totalEggs = 6; Then he console.logs totalEggs, goes to the console and types in collectEggs.
            So we start with 
            <blockquote>
                function collectEggs() { <br>
                    let totalEggs = 6; <br>
                    console.log(totalEggs) <br>
                    } <br>
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>We go to the console and enter collectEggs() and we get 6.</p>
        <blockquote>
            collectEggs() <br>
            6 <br>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We then take the console.log(totalEggs) outside of the function</p>
        <blockquote>
            function collectEggs() {
                let totalEggs = 6;
                }
                console.log(totalEggs)
        </blockquote>
        <p>Now when we try to run that code we get totalEggs is not defined </p>
        <p>why? Well it's in a function which hasn't been executed yet</p>
        <p>What if we run the function first? </p>
        <blockquote>
            function collectEggs() {
                let totalEggs = 6;
                }
                collectEggs();
                console.log(totalEggs);
        </blockquote>
        <p>Nope, totalEggs is still not defined. What we are seeing here is function scope.</p>
        <p>Variables that we define inside of a function, where we use the let keyword, they are scoped to that function, so we 
            don't have access to that function after the fact. IT's like a little bubble, between the two braces of the 
            fucntion is it's own little world with a glass dome around it, and totalEggs only lives in there.
        </p>
        <p>
            So if I really needed access to totalEggs, we can create a variable outside of the function (above) and then inside the function
            remove the (let) of let totalEggs = 6; so that we have totalEggs = 6; so that instead of using the let keyword
            we just update the totalEggs. 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            let totalEggs = 0; <br>
            function collectEggs() { <br>
                totalEggs = 6; <br>
            } <br>
            <br>
            console.log(totalEggs); <br>
            collectEggs(); <br>
            console.log(totalEggs); <br> 
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            So that is an example of function scope. The function acts as a standalone machine that does not affect the world around it. 
            HOwever we can open a door to the function by using the above behaviours. So outside the function
            totalEggs = 0; we console.log(totalEggs) and get zero. We then run the machine and the machine collects 6 eggs. 
            Now we console.log(totalEggs) again and we see that totalEggs now = 6. 
        </p>
        <p>
            okay so now we move onto the scarlet macaw example. The example shows that a variable set outside of the 
            function has an open door into the fucntion by default. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We start with 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            let bird = 'Scarlet Macaw' ;
            function birdWatch() {
                let bird = 'Great Blue Heron' ;
            }
            birdWatch();
            console.log(bird);
        </blockquote>
        And we get back Scarlet Macaw. THat's because the variable inside the function
        is scoped to the function. However, if we console.log(bird) inside the function then we get back 
        Great Blue Heron
        <blockquote>
            let bird = (Scarlet Macaw)
            function birdWatch() {
                let bird = 'Great Blue Heron';
                console.log(bird);
            }
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            THe door exists where we delete the variable from inside the function. We then console.log(bird) and we get 
            Scarlet Macaw
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            let bird = 'Scarlet MAcaw';
            function birdWatch() {
            console.log(bird)
        }
        </blockquote>

        <h2>211. Block Scope</h2>
        <p>
            We start with a very simple example. We have a variable let radius = 8; and then we have a conditional (the if statement)
            We also create another variable msg. When we try and console.log msg it can't becasue it isn;t defined. We can also try PI but
            that also is not defined.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            let radius = 8; <br>
            if (radius > 0) { <br>
                const PI = 3.14159; <br>
                let msg = 'HIIII!' <br>
             } <br>
            console.log(radius) <br>
            console.log(PI) <br>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
           So this one is a block. Inside of the {} we call that a block. Except if it's a function. Then it's not a block.
           A block includes things like conditionals, but also loops. THis basically works in the same way as 
           the function bubble works. let and const are block scoped. var is not block scoped. THat's one of the main reasons
           const and let were introduced. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So if we declare a variable inside of a variable
        </p>
        <blockquote>
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                let msg = 'aeraerarv';
                console.log(msg)
        }
        console.log(msg)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            So in the above the console.log outside the block will be undefined, but defined inside the block. 
        </p>
        <p>We then change the let msg variable to a var </p>
        <blockquote>
            for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                var msg = 'aeraerarv';
                console.log(msg)
        }
        console.log(msg)
        </blockquote>
        <p>Both console.log commands now show the msg. </p>

         <h2>212. Lexical Scope</h2>
         <p>
              <blockquote>
                  function bankRobbery(){ <br>
                      const heroes = ['Spiderman', 'Wolverine', 'Black Panther'] <br>
                      function cryForHelp(){ <br>
                          for (let hero of heroes) { <br>
                              console.log(`Please Help Us, ${hero.toUpperCase()}` <br>

         </p>
         <p>
             So basically a nested function inherits from it's parents/grandparents. It does not work in reverse. 
         </p>
         <blockquote>
            function bankRobbery(){ <br>
                const heroes = ['Spiderman', 'Wolverine', 'Black Panther'] <br>
                function cryForHelp(){ <br>
                    function inner() {
                        for (let hero of heroes) { <br>
                            console.log(`Please Help Us, ${hero.toUpperCase()}` <br>
                    } <br>
                } <br>
            } <br>

        <h2>213. Function Expressions</h2>
        <p>
            Right then, feeling a bit lost. kind of understand the last few vids. Off the top of my noggin, block scope, lexical scope. Forgot function scope. 
            Now we're on function exressions. An entirely different way of defining a function. 
            So far we've been Using
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            function add(x, y){
                return x + y;
            }
        </blockquote>
        <p>The above is called a function statement. WE define a function using a function keyword</p>
        <p>But there is a different way of defining a function and it actually involves storing a function in a variable, as follows</p>
        <blockquote>
            const square = function (num) {
             return num * num;
            }
            square(7);
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            As we can see above the function does not have a name. It's just function and then parentheses.
        </p>
        <p> This is called a function expression and everything to the right of the = is stored in the variable. We use
            it in the same way as any other variable. 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            const add = function (x, y) {
                add x + y;
        }
        </blockquote>
        <p>So the main thing is to recognise that functions are values in javascript. 
            We can store them, we can pass them around. JUst like we can pass around and store a number or an array or an object.</p>

            <p>
                Soon we'll see that we can pass functions as arguments! We can do crazy things! As Colt saysÂ§

        <h2>Higher Order Functions</h2>
        <p>Functions that operate on/with other functions. 
            <ul>
                <h5>They  can:</h5>
                <li>Accept other functions as arguments</li>
                <li>Return a function</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            As we saw previously a function is a value that can be stored in a variable. It can be passed around. So if we can put it in a variable.
            like
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            let greet = function () {
                console.log('Hi!')
            }
        </blockquote>
        <p>I now have stored a function in this variable </p>
        <blockquote>greet</blockquote>
        <p>And we can execute the variable with </p>
        <blockquote>greet()</blockquote>
        and it will return 
        <blockquote>Hi!</blockquote>
        <p>IF I can stored that function as a variable then I can also pass it around as an argument</p>
        <h3>Functions as Arguments</h3>
        <p>We can define a function like this one </p>
        <blockquote>
            function callTwice(func) {  <br>
                func();  <br>
                func();  <br>
            }  <br>
  <br>
            <p> and then pass it as an argument in another function like this!</p>
            function laugh(){  <br>
                console.log("hahahahahahaha")  <br>
            }  <br>
            callTwice(laugh)   <br>
        </blockquote>

        <p>We can use this callTwice to create 2 rolls of a die</p>
        <blockquote>
            function rollDie(){ <br>
                let roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) +1 <br>
                console.log(roll) <br>
            } <br>
             <br>
            callTwice(rollDie) <br>
        </blockquote>
        <p>However, if we do the following</p>
        <blockquote>
            callTwice(rollDie())
        </blockquote>
        <p>Then we are executing rollDie first and then passing the result through callTWice. SO if we roll a 5 then we will get 
            5, 5.
        </p>
        <p>OKay so now we write another function</p>
        <blockquote>
            function callTenTimes(f)
        </blockquote>
        <p>this is going to run ten times</p>
        <p>How do we get something to run ten times?</p>
        <blockquote>
            function callTenTimes(f){
                for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            }
        </blockquote>
        <p>Then we are going to excecute whatever function (f) was passed in</p>
        <blockquote>
        function callTenTimes(f){   <br>
            for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++)  <br>
            f()  <br>
        }  <br>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Okay, that about wraps it up for this section. We have passed a function as an argument inside of another function.
        </p>

        <h2>215. Returning Functions</h2>
        <p>
            Okay so this is pretty cool. We can create a function factory by returning a function. 
            So you make a function. 
        </p>
        <p>First off we make a mystery function</p>
        <h4><b><u>mystery function</u></b></h4>
        <blockquote>
            function makeMysteryFunction() {            <br>
                const rand = Math.random();             <br>
                if (rand > 0.5) {                       <br>
                    return function() {                 <br>
                        console.log('Congrats!')        <br>
                    }                                   <br>
                } else {                                <br>
                return function() {                     <br>
                    alert("Sorry, it's a no.")          <br>
                    }                                   <br>
                }                                       <br>
            }                                           <br>
            const mystery = makeMysteryFunction();      <br>
            mystery();                                  <br>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Right, so the above creates a makeMysteryFunction with a random number generator. If the the rand is > 0.5 ten we console.log
            congrats. Else return alert sorry it's a no. WE then assign and execute makeMysteryFunction() to mystery. We then execute 
            mystery().
        </p>
        <p>Next we are making something that recognises range</p>
        <h4><b><u>Is Between function</u></b></h4>
        <p>TO make a function that reconises if a number is between 50 and 100</p>
            <blockquote>
                function isBetweenFunc(num) {
                    return num >= 50 && num <=100;
                }
            </blockquote>
        <p>Next we are going to make a function that makes other functions. </p>
        <h4><b><u>Function Factory</u></b></h4>
        <p>Okay, here is the interesting stuff.</p>
             <p>In the above we have been writing the functions. What we are going to do now
                 is make a factory function. A function that will make a function.
             </p>
        <p>we make the makeBetweenFunc and we pass in a min and a max. It is going to return a new function. 
            This function is going to accept and argument that we are going to call num.
        </p>
        <p>All we do from within this function is return num >= min && num <= max</p>
        

        <blockquote>
            function makeBetweenFunc(min, max) { <br>
                return function (num) { <br>
                    return num >= min && num <= max; <br>
                } <br>
            } <br>
        </blockquote>
        <p>WE need to then call makeBetweenFunc with a min and a max argument. If we do this into the console then 
            the console returns this to us </p>
        <blockquote>
            makeBetweenFunc(5,10) <br>
                Æ (num) { <br>
                     return num >= min && num <= max; <br>
                } <br>
        </blockquote>

        <P>
            Right, so we then make several other functions that build on the makeBetweenFunc
        </P>
        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>

        <h2>Coding Excerise 45: Methods Excercise</h2>
        <p>
            Let me see if I can remember. we had to create an object 'square' that held the side and then squared the side for the area
            and then * 4 for the perimeter. 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            const square = {
                area: function (side){
                    return side * side;
                },
                perimeter: function(side){
                    return side * 4;

        <p>
            This is a way of catching errors before they crash everything.
            We jsut wrap everyhting we want to test in a try { } and then end it with a console.log(error)
