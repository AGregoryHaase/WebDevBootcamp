        <h2>152. Introduction to Strings</h2><!-- nbsnusb. Numbers, Booleans, Strings, Undefined, Null, Symbol, Bigint-->
        <p>
            So far we have seen numbers and booleans. Now we are on to Strings. These are <b>STRINGS OF CHARACTERS</b>
            <blockquote>Strings are another primitive type in JavaScript. They represent <b>text</b>, and must be wrapped in qoutes</blockquote>
        </p> 
    </section>

    <section id="153">
        <h2>153. Indices &amp; Length</h2>
        <p> <b>STRINGS ARE INDEXED</b></p>
        <P>STRINGS are indexed, every letter in a string has a corresponding number. 
            i.e. Chicken
        <ul>
            <li>C=0</li>
            <li>H=1</li>
            <li>I=2</li>
            <li>C=3</li>
            <li>K=4</li>
            <li>E=5</li>
            <li>N=6</li>
        </ul>
        We have these indeces. If we add [n] after the string variable and then put in a number we are then accessing the 
        nth number in that string. So then if we have <blockquote>let name = "Antony Haase"</blockquote> and then we do <blockquote>name[5]</blockquote>
        then it should return the 5th letter, counting from A as zero. And, yep, I just tested that and it returned <blockquote>'y'</blockquote>
        </P>
        <p>
            If we request a value that doesn't exist. E.g. if we put in name[20] we would have "undefined" returned to us.
            Undefined is a special value, a primitive value and is JS's way of telling us that there is nothing there. WE cover more on this later.
        </p>
        <p>
            We usually don't use these indices in this way. Typically we will check the first character of a string. 
            Colt gives an example of a phone number. We can write logic to check if someone has used a perenthesis to start the number. 
        </p>
        <p><h3>Length</h3>
        every string has a special property of length. So if I go into the console and type <blockquote>name.length</blockquote>
        then it will return the length of the name <blockquote>12</blockquote>
        NOTE, this is not the same as the highest index as we are starting the count of the length from 1, not zero.
        </p>
        <p><h3>concatenation</h3></p>
        <p>
            If we write <blockquote>"poop" + "a" + "scoop"</blockquote>  we get <blockquote>poopascoop</blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>We can create two variables like <blockquote>let name = "Antony Haase";</blockquote>
        <blockquote>let random = "wears big bras";</blockquote> and then go <blockquote>name + random</blockquote>
        and we would get back <blockquote>Antony Haasewears big bras</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>How do I put in a space? you have to do the space in <blockquote>" "</blockquote> 
    so we go <blockquote>name + " " + random</blockquote> this way we get <blockquote>Antony Haase wears big bras</blockquote>
    Cool Beans.
    </p>
    Finally, if we go <blockquote>1 + "hi"</blockquote> then JS tries to coerce them into a common type and the result is a string.

    <section id="154">
        <h2>STRING METHODS</h2>
            <p><b>METHODS ARE BUILT-IN ACTIONS WE CAN PERFORM WITH INDIVIDUAL STRINGS</b></p>
            <p>
                They help us do things like 
                <ul>
                <li>searching within a string</li>
                <li>Replacing part of a string</li>
                <li>Changing the casing of a string</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        <p>
            You can find a list of the methods by typing a 'string.' into the console. Yep, the list is pretty big. 
            You can also find a list of methods on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String">MDN string docs.</a> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Right, so we kick off with writing a <blockquote>let message = "something"</blockquote> and then <blockquote>something.toUpperCase</blockquote>
            which gives <blockquote>SOMETHING</blockquote> we can then write <blockquote>let msgUp = message.upper</blockquote>
            so that when we type <blockquote>msgUp</blockquote> we get <blockquote>MESSAGE</blockquote>
            Here is a snippet taken from the console
            <blockquote>
                let message = "you are amazing and you can do anything" <br>
                undefined <br>
                message.toUpperCase() <br>
                'YOU ARE AMAZING AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING' <br>
                let capsmessage = message.toUpperCase() <br>
                undefined <br>
                capsmessage <br>
                'YOU ARE AMAZING AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING'
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>We can also use .lowerCase</p>
        <p>The next example we see in the video is <b>TRIM</b> 
        basically, it trims spaces from the left or right of a string.</p>
        <p>We can chain methods together. For example, we can do <blockquote>message.trim().toUpperCase()</blockquote>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="155">
        <h2>155. STRING METHODS WITH ARGUMENTS</h2>
        <P>
            Okay, so these look like <blockquote>thing.method(arg)</blockquote>
            <b>Some methods accept arguments that modify their behaviour. Think of them as inputs that we can pass in. 
                We pass these arguments inside of the parentheses.</b>
        </P>
        <p>
            <b>indexOf</b> 
            If we have <blockquote>let tvShow = "catdog"</blockquote>
            then we can use <blockquote>tvShow.indexOf('cat')</blockquote>
            or <blockquote>tvShow.indexOf('dog')</blockquote>
            and it will return to us the position in the index that the (passed in word)
            occurs at.
         </p>
         <p>
             Here is some text from the console 
             <blockquote>
                let tvFilm = 'catdog'; <br> 
                undefined <br>
                tvFilm.indexOf('cat') <br>
                0 <br>
                tvFilm.indexOf('dog') <br>
                3 <br>
             </blockquote>
             If we look for something that isn't in the string then we get -1 e.g. <blockquote>tvFilm.indexOf ('5') <br> -1 </blockquote>
         </p>
         <p>
             Awesome. That's just mega. So now what?
         </p>
         <p>
             Well, Colt says that if you ever have questions about htese methods, especially the more comlicated ones then head
             over to MDN and read the docs. It has examples and info on how it works.
         </p>
         <p>
             <h3>Slice</h3>
             Colt says that something we will see a lot is .slice and here is a snippet from the console
             <blockquote>
                let msg = "this is my message to you" <br>
                undefined <br>
                let sliceMsg = msg.slice(7) <br>
                undefined <br>
                let trimSliceMsg = sliceMsg.trim() <br>
                undefined <br>
                trimSliceMsg <br>
                'my message to you' <br>
             </blockquote>
             We can trim the back of the message too by using .slice(0,10) e.g.
             <blockquote>
                let msgTwo = trimSliceMsg.slice(0,10) <br>
                undefined <br>
                msgTwo <br>
                'my message' <br>
             </blockquote>
         </p>
         <p>
             You can also pass in a negative index. So 
             <blockquote>
                msgTwo.slice(-7)
                'message'
             </blockquote>
         </p>
         <h3>replace</h3>
         <p>
             We have to pass in two arguments, the first is what we want to replace, the second is what we want to replace it with.
             it looks like .replace(thing to be replaced, thing to replace with)
            So, for example, 
            <blockquote>
                name.replace('Haase', 'Gregory') <br>
                'Antony Gregory' <br>
                let name = name.replace('Haase', 'Gregory') <br>
                undefined <br>
                name <br>
                'Antony Gregory' <br>
            </blockquote>
            We also have .repeat 
            <blockquote>
                "love".repeat(20) <br>
                'lovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelovelove' <br>
            </blockquote>
         </p>

    <h3>Coding Excercise 19: More String Methods Practice</h3>
    <p> 
    const word = "skateboard"; <br>
    let facialHair = word.slice(5, 10).replace('o', 'e'); <br>
    facialHair <br>
    'beard' <br>

        <h2>156. String Template Literals - SUPER USEFUL</h2>
        <P>
            TEMPLATE LITERALS. First of all let's look at life without template literals. 
            we would have <blockquote>let product = "artichoke";</blockquote>
            Then <blockquote>let price = 2.25;</blockquote>
            and then <blockquote>let qty = 5;</blockquote>
            and what we want to do is print a string that says something like - you bought x artichoke and the total is price times quantity.
            so for this we can concatonate 
            <blockquote>
                'you bought ' + qty + ' ' + product + '. Total is: ' + price*qty; <br>
                'you bought 5 artichoke. Total is: 11.25'</blockquote>
                While this does work, it is a <em>lot</em> of work. Thankfully we now have template literals. 
            </P>
            <p>
                With template literals, a newer syntax, where we can embed an expression inside the string and that expression will be evaluated and
                  turned into a string. The example given is 
                  <blockquote>
                    `I counted ${3 + 4} sheep`; <br>
                    'I counted 7 sheep'
                  </blockquote>
                  There's a couple of things we must know. We hve to use the backtick (`) character. 
                  We can actually jsut create a string using backticks. 
                  What is special about backticks is that when they are combined with ${}, whatever is inside the curly braces will 
                  be treated as an expression and evaluated.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just did 
                <blockquote>
                    `hey ho, what do you know? Do you know what 59995 divided by 823 is? Sure, it's ${59995 / 823}`; <br>
                    "hey ho, what do you know? Do you know what 59995 divided by 823 is? Sure, it's 72.89793438639126"  
                </blockquote>
                Going back to what we made earlier, without string template literals. we would have 
                <blockquote>
                    `you bought ${qty} ${product}. Total is: $${price * qty}`; <br>
                    'you bought 5 artichoke. Total is: $11.25'
                </blockquote>
                Just to note, we used a double $$ as the first one would escape our string due to it being part of the syntax.                
            </p>
            <p>
                We can also call a method inside of the curly brackets 
                <blockquote>
                    `you bought ${qty} ${product.toUpperCase()}. Total is: $${price * qty}`; <br>
                    'you bought 5 ARTICHOKE. Total is: $11.25'
                </blockquote>

            Both are primative values and can be a bit confusing at first. It can seem as though they have negative connotations. 
            It might seem like they refer to a problem. 
            Both are single value. Both Null and undefined are values.

        <h2>158. Random Numbers &amp; The Math Object</h2>
        <p>
            <b>MATH OBJECT</b> contains properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions
        </p>
       <p>
           Cool, so you type "math" in to the console and hit enter. It brings up a drp down menu of loads of functions and constants.
       </p>
       <p>
           But what is an object? It's a collection of properties and methods. huh, interesting. Instead of "polluting the namespace" as Colt puts it, by simply having the properties and functions immediately available to us. 
           We have to type math. first. So for example we might want PI. instead of typing PI we have to put 
           <blockquote>
            Math.PI <br>
            3.141592653589793 <br>
            Math.E <br>
            2.718281828459045
           </blockquote>
           Read more about the math objects on MDN where there is a page for every single method.
       </p>
       <p>
           we look at <blockquote>Math.floor</blockquote>
           which rounds down
           <blockquote>Math.ceil</blockquote>
           rounds up. 
       </p>
       <p>
         We also look at random numbers. <blockquote>Math.random()</blockquote>  
         gives us a random decimal between 0 and 1(non-inclusive)
       </p>
       <p>
           we then go on to 
           <blockquote>
            Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; <br>
            89

            Okay, so I did the quiz but slightly confused.
            I wasn't getting it right and wasn't sure what to do so I did it in the console. When I did it in the console it worked -
            <blockquote>
                const die1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1; //random number from 1-6 <br>
                const die2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1; //random number from 1-6 <br>
                `roll: You rolled a ${die1} and a ${die2}. They sum to ${die1 + die2};` <br>
            </blockquote>
            It worked. But didn't work on the webdev website quiz page. So I reread the instructions and jsut put 
            <blockquote>
                let roll = `roll: You rolled a ${die1} and a ${die2}. They sum to ${die1 + die2};`
            </blockquote>
            And that worked in the webdev quiz page but didn't work in the console. So, a little bit confused about that. Anyway, time to move on. to the next section.
