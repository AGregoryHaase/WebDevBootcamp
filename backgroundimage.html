        <p>Okay, what is the truth about background? 
            New doc, add sec, h1, I am heading. Makes large section. w80% h800px, background color, centre with margin auto. 
            h1, font size 100px. 
            color white
            give an image instead of a colour to the background. Can set a gradient as background.
            Specify a URL path to where your image is. Get one from your website. 
            In CSS background-image: url("url here please")
        </p></div>
            <div class="image"></div>
            <p>
            Okay, well I can get the gradient image to work but not an actual image. I'm trying to link to an online image. 
            Maybe I should try an image that's on my comp.
            Bloody nora been trying to do this for over an hour now. 2 hours now. 
            It just won't show a fucking image.
