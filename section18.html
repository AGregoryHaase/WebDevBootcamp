        <p>
            JS Objects. Our second data structure. 
            UNlike arrays which is about ordering data ie a 1st, a 2nd, a 3rd.
            With objects our data is stored using key value pairs/properties.
            A property is just two pieces of information and then a <em>key</em>  and then a <em>value</em> , and they form a <em>pair</em> . 
            An <em>object</em> is just a bunch of these pairs.
            <ul>
                <li>Objects are collections of properties</li>
                <li>Properties are a key-value pair</li>
                <li>Rather than accessing data using an index, we use custom keys</li>
            </ul>
        So remember 
        <blockquote>    
            PROPERTY = KEY + VALUE
        </blockquote>
        We use the key to get the data back out. 
        example of key-value pairs
        <blockquote>
            KEY-VALUE pairs
            <br> username: -    'crazyCatLady'
            <br> upvotes -       7
            <br> text -         'great post'
        </blockquote>
        Right then, I've tried to use the console for this but it doesn't seem to work. 
        Anyway, I've copied it below. The left hand element is the key and the right hand side is a value, together they make 
        a properties. Each one is a pair so there are 5 pairs of information and they are all floating around inside the one shared object
        and we stored it in a variable called fitBitData.
        Note that you can have different types of values in an object, similar to an array, however unlike an array which is ordered, there is no need to order an 
        object literal. All that matters is what we store that value under i.e. what is the name of the key.
        <blockquote>
        <br>    fitBitData
        <br>    {TotalSteps: 74839, TotalMiles: 283, avgCalorieBurn: 34934, workoutsThisWeek: '5 of 7', avgGoodSleep: '2:13'}
        <br>    const fitBitData = {
        <br>    TotalSteps       : 74839,
        <br>    TotalMiles       : 283,
        <br>    avgCalorieBurn   : 34934,
        <br>    workoutsThisWeek : '5 of 7',
        <br>    avgGoodSleep     : '2:13' };
        <br>    undefined
        <br>
        <br>    fitBitData.TotalSteps
        <br>    74839

        <h2>186. Creating Object Literals</h2>
        <p>
            THe term object in JS is a bit of a loaded term. When we do typeof[] we get "object".
            From now on when we say Object literal we are refering to these key vlaue pair data stores, this data structure, that we create using 
            curly braces. 
            Here we are going to model a person. THink of the 
            below creates an empty object. Note, objects are also reference types. Rememeber there are primitve types 
            such as numbers strings booleans, undefined, null, or symbol.
            If it is anything else then it's a reference value (i.e. typeof object)
            empty object
            <blockquote>
                const person = {}
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                const person = {firstName: 'Mick', lastName: 'Jagger'}
            </blockquote>
            So above we now have two value pairs. Each pair is a key, a colon, and then a value, seperated by commas. 
            Doing it on seperate lines for longer objects makes it easier to read. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From the console, 
            <blockquote>
            <br>  const person = {firstName: 'Mick', lastName: 'Jagger'};
            <br>    undefined
            <br>    person
            <br>    {firstName: 'Mick', lastName: 'Jagger'}
            <br>    firstName: "Mick"
            <br>    lastName: "Jagger"
            <br>    [[Prototype]]: Object

        <h2>Coding Excercise 29: Our First Object Excercise</h2>
        <p>
            quite chuffed, passed first time of trying, no mistakes. 
            Had to define a new object literal variable with the following properties
            <blockquote>
                const product = {
                <br>    name:"Gummy Bears", 
                <br>    inStock: true, 
                <br>    price: 1.99, 
                <br>    flavors: ["grape", "apple", "cherry"]
              <br>  };

        <h2>187. Accessing Data Out Of Objects</h2>
        <p>
            Two ways of getting information out of an objects. The first we can use square brackets 
        </p>
            <blockquote>
                person['firstName']
            <br>'Antony'
            </blockquote>
        <p>
                The second way is 
                <blockquote>
                    person.lastName
               <br> 'Gregory'
                </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            Both ways return a string. But there is an important distinction. To help us understand what is going on 
            let's talk about what happens when we make an object. When we make a key: 'value', not only the value is returned as a string 
            but the key is also converted to a string (except for symbols, which we will cover later).
            So if we create a some properties that rank certain years as good or bad i.e.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            const yearRank = {1999: "good", 2020: "bad"};
          <br>      undefined
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Something I've just realised is that I cannot pull the information out using the yearRank.1999 method. 
            Using this method returns a "syntax error: unexpected number."
            To get the info out I have to use the yearRank["1999"] method. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the [squarebrackets] method also has some additional functionality in that we can use an expression.
            <blockquote>
                yearRank['2020']
      <br>         'bad'
      <br>         yearRank['20' + '20']
      <br>         'bad'
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            THe above method concatonates the seperate strings in to a key.  
            Why would you use this?
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay so the example given, I'm going to be totally honest, I don't really understand why you would want to use this. 
            <blockquote>
                            let birthYear = 2020
                   <br>     undefined
                   <br>     yearRank[birthYear]
                   <br>     'bad'
                   <br>     birthYear
                   <br>     2020
            </blockquote>
            It seems like you can cross reference properties inside of objects.

        <h2>Coding Excercise 30: Object Access Excercise</h2>
        <p>
            I'm conpletely stumped on this. 
            We are given an object named restaurant that contains a name, address, city and zipcode. 
            We have to create a variable named fullAddress that points to a string using the information from restaurant.
            fullAddress should point to a string that includes the address, city, state, and zipcode from the restaurant object. 
            The address should look like "64 Johnson Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11206"
            Here's the code we get...
            <blockquote>
      <br>          const restaurant = {
      <br>              name: 'Ichiran Ramen',
      <br>              address: `${Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1} Johnson Ave`,
      <br>              city: 'Brooklyn',
      <br>              state: 'NY',
      <br>              zipcode: '11206',
      <br>          }
            </blockquote>
            The address appears as math.random so that people can't cheat on the test.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right, so I need to get this: "64 Johnson Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11206" which is basically excluding the name. 
            I tried to slice it but it's not actually an array. They all appear as a single object i.e. 
        </p>
        <p>
            No idea what's going on here. I got it to work in the console with 
            <blockquote>
                console.log; fullAddress.address +`, ` + fullAddress.city +`, ` + fullAddress.state + ` ` + fullAddress.zipcode;
                <br> '50 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11206'
            </blockquote>

        But that won't work in the actual Colt Steele question page.
        I had to look up the answer on Reddit, which has worked on the answer page but not in the actual console. Here it is.
        <blockquote>
            let fullAddress = restaurant["address"] + restaurant["city"] + restaurant["state"] + restaurant["zipcode"];
        </blockquote>
        BUt yeah, it won't work in the console. Anyway. I've spent 4 hours on this. What a joke. Arghhh.
        </p>
        <p><h4>recap</h4>
            We have 
            <blockquote>
        const palette = {
         <br>   red: '#eb4d4b',
         <br>   yellow: '#f9ca24',
         <br>   blue: '#30336b'
         <br>   }
         </blockquote> 
        We can access data out in 3 ways.
        <blockquote>
            palette.red
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            palette['blue']
        </blockquote>
        let color = 'yellow';
        palette[color]
        </p>

        <h2>188. Modifying Objects</h2>
        <p>
            We start by recapping how to access data. I think I need to recap this myself. 
            I had Claude Friday till Sunday and then went to see Russel BRand on Monday night. Tuesday was a bit of a write off. 
            It's amazing how quickly your brain can foret. Really annoying. Okay, I just put a recap on the end of the last section. 
            Still not sure about it. I'll have to recap this section. Let's crack on with updating
        </p>
        We create an object called midterms.
        <blockquote>
            const midterms = {danielle: 96, Thomas: 78}
        </blockquote>
        lets say we got thomas' score wrong and we want to upgrade it to 79.
        <blockquote>
            midterms.Thomas = 79
        </blockquote>
        we can also add in new people
        <blockquote>
            midterms.ezra = 85
        </blockquote>

    <section id="189">

            </p>
            Okay, that is the end of this section. Colt does show us some code from reddit in which there are numerous arrays and objects nested within each other.
